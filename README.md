# pizza_shop_management_system

A simulation of pizza management system. It was my first interaction with threads, processes and mutexes. This was an exciting non-sleep work of 2-3 days to make everything work. 
It was a technical task for embedded systems software developer position at Green Technology Systems company based in Korea. I eventually received an offer with reallocation from the company.
